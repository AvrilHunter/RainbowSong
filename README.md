Now adding a new line

If I added more code into line 7 then does it make all of the below not look like a good change?

I am adding more information on 7th Feb 
Now I am going to edit this again but in VSC

I think I may need to do double spacing for it to show as a new line on Github

I have changed the text on this line - lets see if I can merge it later? I edited manually

moved it down one extra line.

function thisIsAFunction() {
console.log("I don't want to display this")

console.log("a second line of data")
}

const addData = [9,10,6,4]
const longer = addData.push(5,6)
